def binary_search(array: list[int], target: int) -> int:
    """
    This function uses binary search to look for a target using a loop.
    Time complexity => O(logn)
    Args:
        array (list[int]): The ordered list of integers in which the user must search in.
        target (int): The integer that a user is searching for.

    Returns:
        int: This is the index that the function will return if found and return -1 if not found.
            -1 will be returned since we are telling the computer that this is the index the target will be if it were to be added.
